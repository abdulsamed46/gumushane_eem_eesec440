## I. Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are very powerful tools capable of mapping input data into output data that can have utmost complexity. The increment in computational power provided by the new generation Graphical Processing Units (GPU) in the last decade enabled ANN to solve many engineering problems in various fields of study (e.g., Computer Vision, speech recognition, Natural Language Processing, power transfer [1], etc). There are different flavors of ANN designed for different applications depending on the needs. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most preferred type of network commonly employed in regression and classification problems, which are two major functions of a ANN.
### A. Multi-layer Perceptron
We will look at MLP elaborately throughout the course. Regression and classification examples, both supervised learning. Please see *Fig. 1* for an example MLP network structure.

### B. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In weeks X-Y-Z, we will look at a classification example on images. Cats-dogs image repository on Kaggle. We will follow the tutorial given in [2]. Please see Figures 5 and 6 for classification of cat and dog images via CNN.
